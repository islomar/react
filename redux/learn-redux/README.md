## Notes
* With Redux, we keep all our data on a Store. Instead of having several states, we have one only big store (WTF).
* Actions: smth that happens in your application, it dispatches an action, which has two things: the action that happened and info needed.
* Reducers: once I get the action, how do I update the data.
* Depending on the size, create one actionCreator per file
